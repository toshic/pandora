## Basic configuration

Pandora supports config files in `YAML` format. Create a new file named `load.yaml` and add following lines in your
favourite editor:

```yaml
pools:
  - id: HTTP pool                    # pool name (for your choice)
    gun:
      type: http                     # gun type
      target: example.com:80         # gun target
    ammo:
      type: uri                      # ammo format
      file: ./ammo.uri               # ammo File
    result:
      type: phout                    # report format (phout is compatible with Yandex.Tank)
      destination: ./phout.log       # report file name

    rps:                             # shooting schedule
      type: line                     # linear growth
      from: 1                        # from 1 response per second
      to: 5                          # to 5 responses per second
      duration: 60s                  # for 60 seconds

    startup:                         # instances startup schedule
      type: once                     # start 10 instances
      times: 10
```

## Monitoring and Logging

You can enable debug information about gun (e.g. monitoring and additional logging).

```yaml
log:                                 # gun logging configuration
  level: error                       # log only `error` messages (`debug` for verbose logging)

monitoring:
  expvar:                            # gun statistics HTTP server
    enabled: true
    port: 1234
  cpuprofile:                        # cpu profiling
    enabled: true
    file: "cpuprofile.log"
  memprofile:                        # mem profiling
    enabled: true
    file: "memprofile.log"
```


## Variables from env and files

You can use variables in the config from environment variables or from files.

The template format is `${...}`.

Environment variable `${env:MY_ENV}`
Variable from file `${property:path/file.property#MY_FIELD}`.

The contents of the file must be

`MY_FIELD=data`

Example config

```yaml
pools:
  - ammo:
    type: uri
    file: ./ammofile
    headers:
      - "[Host: yourhost.tld]"
      - "[User-Agent: ${env:LOAD_USER_AGENT}]"
      - "[Custom-Header: ${property:path/file.property#MY_FIELD}]"
```

You can use variables not only in the header section but also in other configuration fields.
